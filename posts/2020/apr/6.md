The U.S. Department of Agriculture has offered to create emergency facilities for the "depopulation and disposal" of livestock that have become unusable by the meat industry.

While [slaughterhouses across the country are closing](https://cleanmeat.news/posts/2020/apr/1), animals on factory farms continue growing. Thousands of animals are reaching market weight that will not be able to be sent to meat processing plants. If they aren't disposed of, farms will run out of space as younger animals continue growing.

[WSJ reports](https://www.wsj.com/articles/pork-industry-usda-discuss-euthanizing-hogs-after-coronavirus-closes-plants-11588015611) that USDA is considering using carbon dioxide gas in rooms full of pigs to kill them. The government stepping in to eliminate livestock is not unprecedented; USDA killed 31.5 million birds in 2015 in the midst of the avian influenza outbreak.
