Tyson Foods, the world's second-largest producer of meat, has taken out a full-page advertisement in the New York Times to warn of the dire situation in the American meat industry.

**"Millions of pounds of meat will disappear from the supply chain,"** CEO John Tyson stated. Factory farms across the country are being forced to close due to the coronavirus.
