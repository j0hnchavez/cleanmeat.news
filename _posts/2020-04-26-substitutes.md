The plant-based meat industry has shown signs of strength in the midst of the coronavirus crisis. Sales of plant-based meat are more than double what they were at this point in time last year.

Meanwhile, meat production in the US is falling rapidly: 32% of pork and 14% of beef production has been shut down in recent weeks.

Note: while the sub-headline states "plant-based alternative sales jump 200 per cent in US," this is misleading. The cited statistic shows the year-long rise in popularity of plant-based meat, not a recent uptick in sales. Still, it demonstrates the resilience of the novel meat alternative market.
