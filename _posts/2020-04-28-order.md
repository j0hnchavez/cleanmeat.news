President Trump will order American slaughterhouses to remain open amidst the coronavirus pandemic. Meat processing plants will be designated as critical infrastructure so that Trump can mandate their continued operation under the Defense Production Act.

Slaughterhouses have been closing across the country in recent weeks. 6,500 American meat packing workers have either tested positive for the virus or been forced into self-quarantine after being in close contact with an infected worker.
