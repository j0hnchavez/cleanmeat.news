## **[Why Meatpacking Plants are COVID-19 Hotspots](https://cleanmeat.news/posts/2020/may/1)**

Chances are you've heard that meatpacking plant workers are falling ill to the coronavirus across the world. But why has the virus found such a strong foothold in these conditions?

A CDC report has pointed to several possible reasons. Firstly, meatpackers work long shifts in close proximity to dozens of fellow workers. Secondly, the work of processing meat on an assembly line is rapid and tends to lead to heavy breathing, which increases the spread of the virus. Lastly, meat plants are kept at low temperatures to preserve the raw meat, and COVID-19 is better able to survive in colder environments.

These 3 reasons help to explain the observed high rates of COVID-19 in meat plants. Whatever the full explanation may be, it's worth pointing out that clean meat brewing facilities not recreate the conditions that have led to this predicament. A carnery (meat brewery) will make use of industrial-scale bioreactors and automated food processing, and the meat itself will never come into contact with zoonotic diseases in the first place.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture has offered to create emergency facilities for the "depopulation and disposal" of livestock that have become unusable by the meat industry.

While [slaughterhouses across the country are closing](https://cleanmeat.news/posts/2020/apr/1), animals on factory farms continue growing. Thousands of animals are reaching market weight that will not be able to be sent to meat processing plants. If they aren't disposed of, farms will run out of space as younger animals continue growing.

[WSJ reports](https://www.wsj.com/articles/pork-industry-usda-discuss-euthanizing-hogs-after-coronavirus-closes-plants-11588015611) that USDA is considering using carbon dioxide gas in rooms full of pigs to kill them. The government stepping in to eliminate livestock is not unprecedented; USDA killed 31.5 million birds in 2015 in the midst of the avian influenza outbreak.

President Trump will order American slaughterhouses to remain open amidst the coronavirus pandemic. Meat processing plants will be designated as critical infrastructure so that Trump can mandate their continued operation under the Defense Production Act.

Slaughterhouses have been closing across the country in recent weeks. 6,500 American meat packing workers have either tested positive for the virus or been forced into self-quarantine after being in close contact with an infected worker.

Tyson Foods, the world's second-largest producer of meat, has taken out a full-page advertisement in the New York Times to warn of the dire situation in the American meat industry.

**"Millions of pounds of meat will disappear from the supply chain,"** CEO John Tyson stated. Factory farms across the country are being forced to close due to the coronavirus.

The plant-based meat industry has shown signs of strength in the midst of the coronavirus crisis. Sales of plant-based meat are more than double what they were at this point in time last year.

Meanwhile, meat production in the US is falling rapidly: 32% of pork and 14% of beef production has been shut down in recent weeks.

Note: while the sub-headline states "plant-based alternative sales jump 200 per cent in US," this is misleading. The cited statistic shows the year-long rise in popularity of plant-based meat, not a recent uptick in sales. Still, it demonstrates the resilience of the novel meat alternative market.

The coronavirus pandemic was likely incubated in the open-air "wet" meat markets of China. Traditional means of meat production will continue to be a festering ground for disease into the foreseeable future.

Lab-grown "clean" meat can one day be produced in factory conditions as sanitary as a run-of-the-mill Coors Light brewery. Mass-production breweries have caused 0 pandemics so far.

Meat producers across the US are closing facilities in response to the coronavirus crisis.

In addition to the economic fallout being felt across the country, slaughterhouses have experienced outbreaks of COVID-19 among their factory workers.
