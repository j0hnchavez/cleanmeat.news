The plant-based meat industry has shown signs of strength in the midst of the coronavirus crisis. As pork prices rise and slaughterhouses are forced to shutter their doors, sales in plant based meat are more than double what they were at this point in time last year.

The coronavirus pandemic was likely incubated in the open-air "wet" meat markets of China. Traditional means of meat production will continue to be a festering ground for disease into the foreseeable future.

Lab-grown "clean" meat can one day be produced in factory conditions as sanitary as a run-of-the-mill Coors Light brewery. Mass-production breweries have caused 0 pandemics so far.
