# About

Cleanmeat.news is a news aggregator for the lab-grown/clean meat industry.

It is run by [John Chavez][1], new college grad and industry enthusiast.

The code for this site is open source. [See for yourself][2]. I promise I am not spying on you. This is my first website and it's written from scratch (no Squarespace/Wix etc.).
