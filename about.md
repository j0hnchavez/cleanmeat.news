<div class="main-div" style="text-align:left !important;" markdown="1">

The purpose of this site is to provide the most up-to-date and informative news for the lab-grown meat industry. Its purpose is not to convince the reader of the need for such technology -- good cases for the adoption of clean meat can be found here and here. The purpose is also not to explain the science of clean meat -- quality examples of that include this and this. The purpose of the site is simply to inform the reader of the current state of the industry.

This site will regularly inform the reader of important trends in the conventional meat industry. The reason for this is that cell-cultured meat is an attempt to disrupt the current meat industry, and if it is to be succesful it ought to learn from the strengths and weaknesses of the status quo. Articles about plant-based meat alternatives will also be featured occasionally, because the plant-based meat industry can be learned from as a precursor to the clean meat industry.

The code for this site is open source. [See for yourself][1]. It is written from scratch, without the use of sitemakers like Squarespace or Wix.

**Why "clean meat" news?**

We are part of an industry of many names. Meat grown in bioreactors rather than animal bodies has been referred to with a bewildering array of adjectives: clean, cultured, cultivated, lab-grown, cell-based, cell-ag, and more. The use of "clean meat" is a purposeful editorial decision. 

It was the first widespread term for the industry after "lab-grown." It is [much more appealing to consumers][3] than "lab-grown." It is also more technically accurate, as clean meat will be grown in factories resembling beer breweries rather than in laboratories. Additionally, the term benefits from an implicit association with clean energy and the downright uncleanliness of factory farming. 

However, the term was abandoned in favor of terms like "cultured" and "cultivated" when industry leaders like [The Good Food Institute decided][4] that it failed a "minimum standard of neutrality." This makes sense, especially when considering that organizations like the GFI value working closely with the conventional meat industry. Publicists for factory farming corporations have expressed strong disapproval of the term "clean meat" because of its implication that traditional meat is unclean. But this site has no reason to tiptoe around the feelings of Tyson marketers. Factory farms an unclean festering grounds of disease and slaughtered animal carcasses. Bioreactors can make clean meat: meat that's environmentally, morally, and biologically clean. We're trying to make clean meat.
